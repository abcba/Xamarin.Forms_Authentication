## Xamarin.Forms Login Authentication Sample
This is a login sample which uses Xamarin.Auth and implements custom renderers to create a login page. 
Code is fairly straight forward. You are welcome to use the code as a starting point for your project. In each of the customRenderers
you will need to change the OAuth Credentials to reflect your credentials. 
Be sure to give a star if it works and helps you :)
